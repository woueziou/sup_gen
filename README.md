# SupGen (Supabase Dart Class Generator)

A Dart package for generating classes, enums, and views directly from a Supabase PostgreSQL server. Simplify the process of integrating your database schema into your Dart/Flutter projects.

## Features

- Automatically generate Dart classes from PostgreSQL tables.
- Replicate enum types and views from the `public` schema or a specified schema.
- Easy configuration and seamless integration.

## Installation

### 1. Add the package to your project

Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  supabase_dart_generator: ^<latest_version>
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.3.3
```

Replace **<latest_version>** with the latest version of the package.

Run the following command to fetch the pacakge
```bash
flutter pub get
# or
dart pub get
```

### 2. Configure your project
##### Add configration to pubspec.yml
#
```yaml
sup_gen_option:
  output: lib/supabase_models #the desired output folder 
  enable: true # Enable or disable the package 
  schema: 'public' #The schema that will be used
  useSsl: false # control if the ssl is required for the server or no
```
##### Add .env file
#
include you Supabase database credential

```env
# .env file
SUPABASE_DB_USER=postgres
SUPABASE_DB_HOST=DB_HOST
SUPABASE_DB_PORT=DB_PORT
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
SUPABASE_DB_SCHEMA=public
SUPABASE_DB=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
```
⚠️ Important: Keep your .env file secure. Do not commit it to version control. You don't want to give the key of you home to the world


### 3. Generate classes

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```
You will see in your output folder some files:
-  supabase_enums.gen.dart  // for enums
-  supabase_tables.gen.dart // for tables
